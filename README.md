  * "To produce election data using 2020 precinct boundaries, election results were projected down to the 2010 block level using voting-age population as weights. Results for 2020 blocks were then estimated using 2010 blocks and the land-use-based crosswalk files from VEST. Finally, 2020 blocks were aggregated to 2020 Census VTDs using the Census' 2020 block assignment files."
